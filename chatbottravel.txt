This chatbot provides responses to user queries related to bus booking, availability, and travel destinations.

Explanation:

The responses dictionary contains patterns and corresponding responses for the bus travel chatbot. Each key in the dictionary represents a category of user queries, such as greetings, booking, availability, fare, goodbye, and default.
The generate_response function takes user input, processes it, and returns an appropriate response based on the input pattern.
The bus_travel_chatbot function handles the main interaction with the user. It prompts the user for input, generates responses using the generate_response function, and continues the interaction until the user inputs "bye" or "thank you".
