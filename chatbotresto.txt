This Python program implements a simple restaurant chatbot.

Import Libraries: The random library is imported to generate random responses.
Responses Dictionary: A dictionary named responses is defined, containing various patterns as keys and corresponding lists of responses as values. Each key represents a pattern or query that the user might input, and the list contains different responses for that pattern.
Generate Response Function: The generate_response function takes the user's input as a parameter and generates a response based on the input pattern. It first converts the input to lowercase for case-insensitive matching. Then, it checks for specific keywords or patterns in the input and selects a random response from the corresponding list in the responses dictionary. If the input does not match any specific pattern, a default response is selected.
Restaurant Chatbot Function: The restaurant_chatbot function handles the interaction with the user. It starts by printing a welcome message and instructions. Then, it enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input, generates a response using the generate_response function, and prints the response. The loop continues until the user inputs "bye" or "thank you", at which point the chatbot exits.
Running the Chatbot: Finally, the restaurant_chatbot function is called to run the chatbot.

The chatbot provides appropriate responses based on the user's input, including greetings, menu inquiries, ordering requests, asking for specials, and farewells.
